Hubsolv Backend Test
=============

This task was carried out in Laravel, using Postman to test API endpoints. An sqlite database was used

### Assumptions ###

Some assumptions made were:
* Price could be stored as a decimal value and a currency signifier added in the front end, as opposed to storing 'X.XX GBP' as a string field,
* A correctly formed ISBN consists of 13 digits, separated by a dash for a 14 character string. Therefore an invalid ISBN is a string longer than 14 characters.
